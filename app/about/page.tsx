      <p className="max-w-2xl text-slate-300">
        I’m Aaron Beschorner Lira — a data analyst, data scientist, and 
        data engineer with a passion for understanding complex systems and 
        telling stories with data. I combine mathematical foundations with 
        modern engineering tools to build solutions that scale.

        Outside of the technical world, I’m deeply interested in fashion, 
        design, electronic music, and exploring new creative expressions. 
        This website is a mix of my technical journey and the aesthetic 
        interests that shape who I am.
