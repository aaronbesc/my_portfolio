# When We Eat, We Eat Right
## 02.08.2026
<br></br>
After more than four years living in Gainesville, and with my college life coming to an end,  
I think it’s fair to say I’m basically a local. So I’ll stop gatekeeping and share my personal list of places I go to all the time. Not everything I’ve tried, just the spots I love and keep coming back to. At the very end, you’ll find a flow diagram. I learned how to make these in my Digital Logic class (thanks Dr. Schwartz that’s about all I remember), and the idea is that depending on the vibe, you can make a more accurate choice.

<PlaceCard
  name="Germain's"
  vibe=" From their instagram page: 'a fast casual restaurant serving dark meat gourmet chicken sandwiches'"
  address=" 220 NW 8th Ave #10, Gainesville, FL 32601"
  myOrder=" The OG"
  why=" I discovered it after going broke at Flashbacks, the thrift store next door. I first stopped in for an iced latte (insanely good), sat at the bar, and immediately resonated the crew and the interior design. The second time I came back for the original chicken sandwich and it sealed the deal. Also, please go follow them on Instagram, their branding is the cutest."

<PlaceCard
  name="Dick Mondell's"
  vibe=" Greasy burger cravings, no thinking required"
  address=" 412 SW 4th Ave, Gainesville, FL 32601"
  myOrder=" The Original Big Dick + Bacon + Small Natural Cut Fries"
  why=" honestly, my safe place. When I don’t want to think too much and I’m craving a good burger, I just take the 15-minute walk from Midtown and get the original. I always sit there, easy, quick, and a solid meal for a good price."
/>

<PlaceCard
  name="Muñecas"
  vibe=" A miami fusion restaurant and bar specialized in handcrafted tacos (I like the bowls better)"
  address=" 317 SW 4th Ave, Gainesville, FL 32601"
  myOrder=" Balsamic Steak Bowl OR Mojo Pork Quesadilla"
  why=" I think 4th Ave Food Park is currently my favorite place in Gainesville to hang out with friends, and what makes it even better is Muñecas being there. As I said before, the balsamic steak or shrimp bowl with plantains is insane: filling, flavorful, and somehow a perfect hybrid between a Cuban and Mexican bowl. I’ve also gone just for drinks at the bar and had a great time too."

<PlaceCard
  name="Satchel's Pizza"
  vibe=" A pizza shop, live music venue, and toy store"
  address=" 1800 NE 23rd Ave, Gainesville, FL 32609"
  myOrder=" Ricotta + Sundried Tomatoes OR Pepperoni + Hot Honey AND Grape Soda"
  why=" this place is a fever dream that somehow makes perfect sense. You really have to go to understand the vibe. It’s incredibly fun, and the pizzas are genuinely good. Be careful with the portions. The larger size can easily be too much even for two people. If it’s just the two of you, I’d recommend sharing a salad and a small pizza instead. Also, make sure to check out the little store next door."
