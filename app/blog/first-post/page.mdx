Creating a personal website used to feel like a chore — setting up templates, fighting with CSS, and manually building blog pages.  
But with **Next.js App Router**, **MDX**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the experience becomes clean, elegant, and honestly… fun.

This post walks through how I structured and built the foundation of this site.

## Why I Built a New Portfolio

After years of school, research, creative projects, and industry work, I needed a place where all the pieces of my engineering + creative identity could live together:

- 💡 **Data Science** projects  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** research  
- 🏗️ **Full-stack engineering** work  
- 🎨 **Fashion + creative tech** experiments  
- ✍️ **A personal blog** to reflect and share  

My goal was to build something:

- blazing fast ⚡  
- scalable  
- aesthetically modern  
- future-proof (2025 standards)  
- easy to write blog posts for  

Next.js + MDX + Tailwind delivered perfectly.
